This Repository is all about the popular Software Engineering Lab concepts and their variations, Which can be helpful to Coding Interviews. I have tried Software engineering, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. 

Software engineering is designing, building, testing, and maintaining software systems. It involves applying engineering principles and practices to software development to ensure its quality, reliability, and efficiency.

Software engineers develop software solutions using various tools, programming languages, and methodologies. They work closely with stakeholders, such as clients and end-users, to understand their requirements and create software that meets their needs and expectations.

Software engineering typically involves several phases, including requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Throughout these phases, software engineers follow industry best practices, such as using version control systems, conducting code reviews, and performing thorough testing to ensure the quality of the software.

Software engineers must consider scalability, security, and performance factors when developing software systems.
